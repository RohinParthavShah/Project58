   <p>One of the reasons why reading is the best hobby is because it expands your horizons. It gives you something new and different to enjoy. And there are so many diverse subjects that you can read about that you are learning something every time that you read. You can learn practically anything from reading a good book on the subject. Even if you choose to read fiction, you may learn something that is helpful in your life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Reading causes your mind to work differently than when you are watching television. It is a way to stretch your mind to grasp new concepts. It also makes your mind work to interpret images. It is healthy for your brain and keeps your brain functioning actively. This can help keep your mentality sharp as you age.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another one of the advantages about this hobby is that it increases your vocabulary. You can learn so many new words from reading. I think that this is a tremendous advantage. Having a good handle on vocabulary helps you to speak properly and to sound educated. If you don’t know a word you run onto when you are reading, look it up.

    <p>One of my favorite time periods to read about is World War II. I would not know nearly as much as I do about this period in history if there weren’t so many books that I could read to learn about it. You can travel to nearly any period in time that you wish to simply by picking up a book. You can read non-fiction and get the straight, no-nonsense facts or indulge in some juicy fiction from that time period. Reading can take you to any time period that you want to go to.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Reading indulges your imagination. When you turn on a television, there is no need to imagine anything because it is already placed before you in a visual setting. Reading is not like that. When you read, you have to come up with your own visual images to go along with the book. Sometimes when I am beginning a book, I will stop and take a few minutes to just sit and think about how I want the characters to appear to me. It is quite enjoyable to do so.<p>
    <br>
    <p>Reading is such a peaceful hobby. You can do it in complete silence and just enjoy the serenity of hearing nothing but your inner thoughts as you make your way through a book. It inspires a peaceful feeling. Many are the times that I sighed a deep, contented sigh as I read the last page of a good book. I don’t know anything else that offers such enjoyment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When you read, the world is at your feet. Just like you can travel to different periods of time when you read, you can do the same with places. You can read about places that you may never have the opportunity to visit. That may be the only way that you would have ever known about different places in the world. It can be very enlightening to travel through reading.<p>
    <br>
    <p>Reading is such a passionate love of mine. What about you? What are your favorite types of books to read?</p>
